1.Emmet:
Emmet is like a magical shortcut for writing HTML and CSS faster. It helps you type less and do more by using abbreviations to generate code.
For example, instead of writing a full HTML tag like <div></div>, you can just type div and Emmet will expand it for you.

2.Difference between a Library and Framework:
A library is like a collection of tools or functions that you can use in your code. You call these tools when you need them.
A framework is like a set of rules and tools that dictate how you should build your entire application. It's more like a blueprint for your project.
CDN (Content Delivery Network):
A CDN is like a super-fast internet delivery service for website files. It stores copies of files (like JavaScript, CSS, and images) on servers all around the world.
We use CDNs to make websites load quickly for people no matter where they are.

3.Why is React known as React?:
React is named "React" because it's all about how your web application reacts to changes in data. It helps you build user interfaces that update
and respond to user actions without manually changing the whole webpage.

4.crossorigin in script tag:
The crossorigin attribute in a script tag is like a security feature. It tells the browser whether a script from a different website (origin) is allowed to be loaded and executed on your webpage.

5.Difference between React and ReactDOM:
React is like the core of React applications. It's responsible for defining and managing your UI components, handling state, and rendering them.
ReactDOM is like the bridge between React and the web browser. It helps React to interact with the actual web page by rendering your components onto the HTML DOM.

6.Difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN:
react.development.js is for development. It includes helpful error messages and warnings that make it easier to find and fix issues during development.
react.production.js is for production. It's optimized for performance and doesn't include extra warnings and messages, which makes your website faster but less helpful for debugging.

7.async and defer:
async: When you add async to a script tag, it tells the browser to download the script while the page continues to load. When the script is ready, it runs, but the order may not be guaranteed.
defer: When you add defer to a script tag, it also downloads the script while the page loads, but it waits until the page is fully parsed before running the script. The order of execution is maintained.
I hope these explanations help you understand these concepts better! If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
